A new version of our Image Editing API – v2 – is now available, offering enhanced stability, improved reliability, and a smoother experience for developers. We recommend using v2 for all new integrations. If you're currently using v1, there's a transition period in place to help you migrate at your own pace.

What’s New in v2
Bria API v2 builds on the solid foundation of v1, introducing enhancements that make integration even smoother and more scalable:

Async by Default – All endpoints now use asynchronous processing by default, enabling better scalability and performance for high-volume workflows.
Status Service – A new service designed to support async processing. It allows you to track the status of each request in real time and manage results more effectively.
Request ID for Every Call – Each request now includes a unique Request ID, making it easier to trace, debug issues, and collaborate with support when needed.
Unified Request & Response Format – Standardized structures across endpoints simplify integration and response handling.
Simplified Output Handling – Each request now returns a single result, making it easier to work with the output.
Consistent Error Handling – All endpoints now use a shared error structure with standardized codes and messages for better clarity.
Prompt-Level Moderation – Image Editing now supports prompt-level content moderation, helping automatically block unsafe or restricted terms.
Separate Moderation for Input and Output Images – Visual content moderation has been split to allow separate controls for input and output images, giving you more granular moderation flexibility across the flow.
Migration Timeline
The new version of our API – v2 – will run in parallel with the existing v1 endpoints for a limited transition period, giving you time to migrate smoothly.

Image Editing:
Both versions are currently supported. Support for v1 endpoints will officially end on November 15, 2025.

Image Generation and Tailored Generation (Phase 2), and Product Shot Editing (Phase 3):
Migration timelines will be shared separately as those capabilities become available in v2.

We recommend starting the migration process early to ensure a smooth transition.

Integration Notes
If you're currently using Bria API v1 for Image Editing, we encourage you to begin migrating to v2 to take advantage of the new improvements and ensure future compatibility.

Other integration methods — including iframe, MCP server, Photoshop and Figma plugins, and ComfyUI nodes — are not affected by this update.

Image Generation
/
Overview
Overview
Copy

Bria’s Image Generation API provides builders with a flexible and controllable way to generate high-quality visuals from textual prompts or reference images. It supports various resolutions, aspect ratios, and generation speeds, enabling scalable and efficient production of photos, illustrations, and vector graphics for commercial use.

API Access

You can register and access the API Token through Bria's platform by clicking here.

Our latest image generation API (V2) is built around FIBO, a next-gen visual model trained on structured JSON descriptions of images for precise, controllable generation. These endpoints utilize a two-step process:

A VLM Bridge translates your input (text/images) into a detailed, machine-readable structured_prompt (JSON).
The FIBO image model generates the final image based on the structured_prompt.
These APIa offers two VLM bridge options:

Gemini 2.5 Flash: Used by the /image/generate endpoints for state-of-the-art, detailed prompt creation.
FIBO-VLM (Open): (Coming Soon) Used by the /image/generate/lite endpoints as part of the Fibo Lite Pipeline. By pairing the distilled Fibo Lite text-to-image model with the FIBO-VLM bridge, the entire pipeline is capable of fully local, on-prem deployment. To learn more, contact us at support@bria.ai.
You can use the all-in-one /image/generate endpoints or decouple these steps using the /structured_prompt/generate endpoints for maximum control and automation. See the v2 endpoints tag description below for more details.

V1 Endpoints: We also provide access to our previous generation (V1) endpoints. These offer distinct pipelines like Base, Fast, HD, Vector generation, and Reimagine. Some V1 endpoints support unique Guidance Methods like ControlNets. See the v1 endpoints tag description below for details on these legacy features.

IP-related prompts Our models are trained exclusively on fully licensed, safe-for-commercial-use data. Prompts that reference public figures, brands, or other protected content may result in generic or altered outputs. These prompts are not blocked, but results may differ from what you expect. If an IP-related signal is detected in the prompt, the following warning will appear in the API response:



  This prompt may contain intellectual property (IP)-protected content. 
  To ensure compliance and safety, certain elements may be omitted or altered. 
  As a result, the output may not fully meet your request.
Advanced Customization and Access: As part of Bria’s Source Code & Weights product, developers seeking deeper customization can access Bria’s source-available GenAI models via Hugging Face. This allows full control over fine-tuning, pipeline creation, and integration into proprietary workflows—empowering AI teams to develop and optimize their own generative AI solutions.

Our latest image generation API (V2) is built around FIBO, a next-gen visual model trained on structured JSON descriptions of images for precise, controllable generation.

Key Features:

Structured Control: Generate images based on detailed JSON prompts for deterministic and auditable results.

VLM Bridge Options: Choose your intent translation engine:

Gemini 2.5 Flash (Default): Uses Gemini 2.5 Flash for state-of-the-art understanding. (/image/generate, /structured_prompt/generate)
FIBO-VLM (Open): (Coming Soon) Used by the /image/generate/lite endpoints as part of the Fibo Lite Pipeline. By pairing the distilled Fibo Lite text-to-image model with the FIBO-VLM bridge, the entire pipeline is capable of fully local, on-prem deployment. To learn more, contact us at support@bria.ai. (/image/generate/lite, /structured_prompt/generate/lite)
Decoupled Workflow: Optionally generate the structured_prompt first (e.g., /structured_prompt/generate) for inspection, editing, automation, or hybrid deployments before generating the image (e.g., /image/generate).

Asynchronous Requests and the Status Service

Bria API v2 endpoints process requests asynchronously by default. When you make an asynchronous request, the API immediately returns a request_id and a status_url instead of the final result. Use the Status Service to track the request's progress until it reaches a completed state.

See the full guide at Status Service Documentation for complete details and usage examples.

Request
Description

Generates a new image based on your inputs.

This all-in-one endpoint first translates your input (prompt and/or images) into a structured JSON prompt using the state-of-the-art Gemini 2.5 Flash VLM bridge. It then internally uses that JSON to generate the final, deterministic image.

Use this endpoint for professional workflows that demand the highest-fidelity interpretation of your creative vision. The response includes both the final image_url and the structured_prompt (JSON).

For advanced, programmatic control, you can also pass in your own structured_prompt (e.g., from a previous response or the /v2/structured_prompt/generate endpoint) to bypass the internal VLM bridge. This allows for precise, auditable refinement or recreation of an image, or to generate multiple variations from the same structured prompt.

Input Combination Rules

The request body must include one of the following mutually exclusive combinations:

prompt (Generates a new image from text)
images (Generates a new image inspired by a reference image)
images + prompt (Generates a new image inspired by an image and guided by text)
structured_prompt (Recreates a previous image exactly, combined with a seed)
structured_prompt + prompt (Refines a previous image using new text instructions, combined with a seed)

Generate Structured Prompt
Copy

Request
Creates a new detailed, machine-readable structured prompt in JSON format or refines an existing one using text or image inputs.

This endpoint uses the state-of-the-art Gemini 2.5 Flash VLM bridge to generate the prompt, providing superior understanding of nuanced or complex inputs. It only returns the JSON string and does not generate an image.

Why use this endpoint?

This endpoint decouples the "intent translation" step from the "image generation" step, giving you maximum flexibility.

It's Optional: The same structured prompt generation happens automatically behind the scenes when using /v2/image/generate.
Control & Auditability: Allows for a "human-in-the-loop" to inspect, programmatically edit, or version the JSON before generating an image (e.g., for a custom UI).
Consistency & Automation: Generate one structured_prompt and pass it to /v2/image/generate multiple times to create consistent, auditable variations.
Hybrid Deployment: Use Bria's state-of-the-art VLM bridge via API while self-hosting the open-source FIBO image model on your own private cloud.
The resulting structured_prompt can be used as input for the /v2/image/generate endpoint.

Input Combination Rules

The request body must use exactly one of the following combinations:

Text Only: prompt
Image Only: images
Image and Text: images and prompt
Structured Prompt and Text: structured_prompt and prompt
** API Access **

You can register and access the API Token through Bria's platform by clicking here.

Headers
api_token
string

Publicly available URL or Base64-encoded image. Currently supports a single image. Supported formats: JPEG, JPG, PNG, WEBP.

structured_prompt
string
A string containing the structured prompt in JSON format. Use a structured_prompt from a previous generation's response.

seed
integer
Seed for deterministic generation. Uses a random seed if omitted. This parameter is optional.

sync
boolean
Response mode. This parameter is optional.

false (default): Asynchronous. Returns 202 with a status_url to poll.
true: Synchronous. Holds the connection and returns 200 with the final result.
Default
false

Generate Image - Lite (Coming Soon)
Copy

Request
Description

Generates a new image based on your inputs using the Fibo Lite Pipeline.

This all-in-one endpoint utilizes a two-step local-compatible process:

FIBO-VLM Bridge: Translates your input (prompt and/or images) into a structured JSON prompt using Bria's open-source VLM.
Fibo Lite Model: Internally uses the distilled Fibo Lite text-to-image model to generate the final visual based on that JSON.
Fibo Lite's Benefit

By pairing the distilled Fibo Lite text-to-image model with the FIBO-VLM bridge, the entire pipeline is capable of fully local, on-prem deployment.

To access the local deployment package, please contact us at support@bria.ai.

For advanced, programmatic control, you can also pass in your own structured_prompt (e.g., from a previous response or the /v2/structured_prompt/generate/lite endpoint) to bypass the internal VLM bridge. This allows for precise, auditable refinement or recreation of an image, or to generate multiple variations from the same structured prompt.

Input Combination Rules

The request body must include one of the following mutually exclusive combinations:

prompt (Generates a new image from text)
images (Generates a new image inspired by a reference image)
images + prompt (Generates a new image inspired by an image and guided by text)
structured_prompt (Recreates a previous image exactly, combined with a seed)
structured_prompt + prompt (Refines a previous image using new text instructions, combined with a seed)
** API Access **

You can register and access the API Token through Bria's platform by clicking here.

Generate Structured Prompt - Lite (Coming Soon)
Copy

Request
Creates a new detailed, machine-readable structured prompt in JSON format or refines an existing one using text or image inputs.

This endpoint uses Bria's standard FIBO-VLM bridge (open-source, available on Hugging Face) to generate the prompt. It only returns the JSON string and does not generate an image.

Why use this endpoint?

This endpoint decouples the "intent translation" step from the "image generation" step, giving you maximum flexibility.

It's Optional: The same structured prompt generation happens automatically behind the scenes when using /v2/image/generate/lite.
Control & Auditability: Allows for a "human-in-the-loop" to inspect, programmatically edit, or version the JSON before generating an image (e.g., for a custom UI).
Consistency & Automation: Generate one structured_prompt and pass it to /v2/image/generate/lite multiple times to create consistent, auditable variations.
Hybrid Deployment: Use Bria's API for the VLM bridge while self-hosting the open-source FIBO image model on your own private cloud.
The resulting structured_prompt can be used as input for the /v2/image/generate/lite endpoint.

Input Combination Rules

The request body must use exactly one of the following combinations:

Text Only: prompt
Image Only: images
Image and Text: images and prompt
Structured Prompt and Text: structured_prompt and prompt
** API Access **

You can register and access the API Token through Bria's platform by clicking here.

Headers
api_token
string
required
Body
application/json
prompt
string
Text-based instruction. Can be used alone to create a new prompt, or as a refinement command with an images or structured_prompt.

images
Array of strings
<= 1 items
Publicly available URL or Base64-encoded image. Currently supports a single image. Supported formats: JPEG, JPG, PNG, WEBP.
