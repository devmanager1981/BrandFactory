Fibo Hackathon IdeaThe "Global Brand Localizer" for hackathon organized 
by Bria.ai 
The Concept: A "Headerless" Ad-Campaign Generator. 
The Pitch: "Enterprises don't need one image; they need 50 localized versions of the same 
image for different markets, all legally compliant." 
The Workflow (Your Build): 
1. Input: A photo of a sneakers product + A "Master JSON" file defining the camera 
angle (locked). 
2. The "Agent": The system iterates through a list of regions (e.g., Tokyo, New York, 
Paris). 
3. FIBO Generation: It injects specific "Background" and "Lighting" parameters into the 
JSON for each region while keeping the Camera/Product Object locked 
(Disentanglement). 
4. The "16-Bit Flex": The output is rendered in 16-bit HDR for print-ready quality 
(Hitting the "Extra Focus" rule). 
5. Compliance Check: The system auto-tags the output with C2PA credentials (proving 
it was made with Bria) and logs the JSON used for audit. 
4. Why This Wins 
● It uses FIBO's unique strength: Other models (Midjourney/DALL-E) cannot 
guarantee the camera angle stays exactly the same when you change the prompt. 
FIBO's JSON structure can. 
● It hits the "Cheat Code": You are using the 16-bit/HDR requirement mentioned in 
the rules. 
● It appeals to the Judges: We are looking for "Production Workflows". This is a tool a 
Global CMO would buy immediately. 
Detailed implementation Plan 
Phase 1: Uncovering the "Unknowns" 
You identified three critical gaps. Here is how we solve them using the current Bria 
ecosystem: 
1. Which Model? (The "Secret" Pipeline) 
● The Trap: Most entrants will use the standard text-to-image API. 
● The Solution: You must use the FIBO Pipeline with the VLM Bridge. This is a 
two-step process: First, a Vision Language Model (VLM) looks at your 
prompt/image and writes the JSON. Second, the FIBO model generates the 
image from that JSON. 
● Library: Use the BriaFiboPipeline from Hugging Face diffusers. This gives you 
raw access to the JSON before generation, which is where your "Agent" lives. 
2. Where is the JSON Schema? (Don't Write It, Generate It) 
● The Trap: You are looking for a documentation page with a list of 100 keys. It 
doesn't exist in a simple list because the schema is dynamic. 
● The Solution: Use the "Inspire" Mode workflow. 
○ Take your "Master Product Image." 
○ Pass it through the VLM Bridge with the prompt "Describe this product 
for a commercial shoot." 
○ The output IS your schema. It will return a JSON object with keys like 
style_medium, lighting, composition, and camera_parameters. Save this 
as master_product.json. This is your template. 
3. C2PA Tooling (The "Trust" Layer) 
● The Trap: Expecting a Bria "Validator API." 
● The Solution: Bria embeds the manifesto into the file during generation. To 
verify it in your demo, use the C2PA Command Line Tool (open source). 
○ Action: Download c2patool. 
○ Demo Script: Run c2patool detailed output_image.jpg in your terminal. It 
will dump a JSON showing "Signed By: Bria AI." This looks incredibly 
professional in a demo video. 
Phase 2: The Revised Technical Plan (Step-by-Step) 
This is your roadmap for the next 10 days. 
Day 1: The "Schema Heist" (Python) 
Your goal: Get the perfect JSON template for your product. 
● Install: pip install diffusers transformers accelerate protobuf 
● Code: Write a script that loads BriaFiboPipeline. 
● Action: Feed it your product image (e.g., a sneaker). 
● Extract: The pipeline returns a json_prompt. Print this to a file. 
● Result: You now have a JSON file containing the exact "DNA" of your product 
(geometry, material, texture). 
Day 2: The "Localization Agent" (The Core Logic) 
Now you build the "Agent" that modifies the environment but keeps the product DNA 
locked. 
Python 
import json 
def generate_local_variant(master_json, locale): 
# Load the Master DNA 
prompt = master_json.copy() 
# DETACH the environment (Disentanglement) 
if locale == "Tokyo": 
prompt["background"] = "Neon lit street, Shibuya crossing, night, bokeh" 
prompt["lighting"]["global"] = "Cool blue and purple neon rim light" 
prompt["lighting"]["shadows"] = "Soft, colorful" 
elif locale == "Paris": 
prompt["background"] = "Haussmann architecture, cafe terrace, sunny morning" 
prompt["lighting"]["global"] = "Warm sunlight, soft shadows" 
# LOCK the Camera (Critical for the "Best Overall" prize) 
# This proves you aren't just prompting randomly 
prompt["camera_parameters"]["angle"] = "Eye level"  
prompt["camera_parameters"]["focal_length"] = "85mm" # Portrait lens 
return prompt 
Day 3: The "16-Bit Cheat Code" 
To hit the "Extra focus on 16-bit/HDR" rule, you need to bypass the standard image 
saver. 
● Logic: The diffusion model internally works with "latents" (floating point 
numbers). Standard pipelines squash this to 8-bit JPGs. 
● The Fix: In diffusers, set output_type="np" (numpy array) instead of "pil". 
● The Save: Use OpenCV to save this high-precision array as a 16-bit TIFF. 
○ cv2.imwrite("output_16bit.tif", image_array_16bit). 
● Why: You can now claim your tool produces "Print-Ready Billboards," not just 
web images. 
Day 4: The Compliance Dashboard 
Don't build a complex UI. Build a folder watcher. 
1. Script: Watch the output folder. 
2. Verify: When a new TIFF appears, run c2patool on it. 
3. Log: Append the result to compliance_audit.csv. 
4. UI: A simple HTML page that displays the image next to its "Pass/Fail" 
compliance badge. 
Video Demo Strategy (The "Winning" Script) 
● 0:00 - 0:20: Show the problem. "CMOs need 50 localizations of this shoe, but AI 
usually hallucinates the logo." 
● 0:20 - 1:00: Show your Master JSON. Highlight the "Locked" product 
parameters. 
● 1:00 - 1:45: Run your script. Show the terminal flying through "Tokyo," "Paris," 
"NYC." 
● 1:45 - 2:30: The Reveal. Open the "Tokyo" image in Photoshop. Zoom in to 
show the 16-bit color depth (no banding). Then run the C2PA tool to show the 
"Signed by Bria" certificate. 
● 2:30 - 3:00: Close with: "This is not a toy. This is a deterministic, compliant, 
commercial asset factory."
