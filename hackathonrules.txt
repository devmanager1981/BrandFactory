About the challenge
FIBO represents a fundamental shift in how AI generates visual content, from text prompts to structured JSON control. Instead of struggling with prompt engineering, you now have deterministic control over every aspect of generation: camera angles, FOV, lighting, color palettes, and composition - all through structured parameters that always work the same way.

The goal of this competition is simple: play, explore, and push FIBO into new directions. Show us applications that matter for real production workflows. Surprise us with real production workflows, fun and engaging experiences and new tools.

⚡You can run FIBO however you like — locally on your own setup, implement ComfyUI nodes, or through professional tools like Nuke. Build automated workflows. Design intelligent agent flows. Have a new user experience. Or push FIBO's capabilities in totally unexpected directions.

The goal is simple: play, explore, and push FIBO into new directions. Show us applications that matter for real production workflows. Surprise us with what you make.


🛡️ FIBO text-to-image foundation model was trained exclusively with more than 1 billion fully licensed images, promising great results and full indemnity in commercial use.

Get started

Bria FIBO models are free to download on Hugging Face: huggingface.co/briaai

JSON-native generation: Use the included LLM to translate natural language prompts into structured JSON for precise control

Learn more about FIBO's architecture and training on our blog: bria.ai/

GitHub repository with code examples and JSON schemas: github.com/bria-ai

API Documentation with parameter reference (camera angle, color palette, FOV, etc.): docs.bria.ai

ComfyUI workflows and ControlNet integration guides are available in the Resources section

Requirements
WHAT TO BUILD
Apply FIBO in an innovative way that showcases its unique capabilities. Think in terms of what falls into the following categories — we'll pick one winner for each:

Categories:

Best Overall

The most impressive and innovative application of Bria FIBO - showcasing JSON-native control, professional parameters in a way that defines the future of enterprise visual AI. Extra focus will be given to innovations that include HDR or a 16-bit color space.

Best Controllability

The most creative use to demonstrate FIBO's new level of output control. It can be a new multimodal ControlNet, a professional new look for parameters like camera angle, FOV, or color palette, or any way to present output controllability.

Best JSON-Native or Agentic Workflow

The most innovative application of FIBO's JSON capabilities - using structured prompts and the LLM translator to build automated, scalable, production-ready visual generation pipelines.

Best New User Experience or Professional Tool

The most practical production application leveraging FIBO's pro-grade controls and disentanglement for real-world creative workflows.

WHAT TO SUBMIT
Choose the category or categories that best align with your project and provide a brief explanation for your choice

Text description that explains the features and functionality of your project

<3-minute demonstration video of your project showing real use cases

Provide a URL to your public code repository with a clear indication of FIBO model use (e.g., README with setup instructions, example outputs, API integration code)

If applicable, include links to any deployed demos or interactive experiences
